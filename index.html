            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
              Bricklaying in China represents one of the most fundamental and
              historically significant construction practices in the world. With
              a history spanning over 5,000 years, Chinese bricklaying
              techniques have evolved from simple clay brick construction to
              sophisticated architectural methodologies that combine traditional
              wisdom with modern innovation.
            </p>
            <p>
              This study examines the current state of bricklaying practices in
              China, focusing on both traditional methods and contemporary
              applications. The research encompasses various aspects including
              material selection, construction techniques, quality control
              measures, and the integration of modern technology in the

                  Changxue Shu舒畅雪 University of Leuven Abstract China's move
                  towards western models of construction is documented by an
                  account of the inconspicuous brickwork of Shanghai-one of the
                  earliest western construction methods introduced into modern
                  China. A series of questions are raised, based on extensive
                  fieldwork. This article records the study of printed resources
                  set within the broader context of circulating western
                  knowledge in China, and summarises types of literature
                  important for construction studies. The paper considers three
                  Chinese books to help explore the sources of western masonry
                  and reveal hitherto un-noted facts. The paper concludes, for
                  the first time, that the simple technology of Victorian brick
                  masonry was a principal source and antecedent of modern
                  Shanghai brickwork. Distinct from the tradition of
                  transmitting construction-related technology by oral
                  instruction, textbooks, handbooks and manuals constituted a
                  new, and powerful means for the dissemination of technical
                  knowledge in modern China. The interpretation of western
                  technology appears to have been selective in Shanghai; a
                  typical example is the brick bonding methods independent of
                  closer bricks compared to English construction. Interestingly,
                  Chinese authors did not fully adopt western construction
                  modes, and old Chinese knowledge was incorporated into new
                  systems of construction, greatly conditioned by material
                  problems, as this study reveals. The spread of construction
                  technology knowledge involved broad cross-field collaboration
                  in and across Shanghai, the complexity of which suggests a
                  shift of knowledge systems, rather than a direct transfer of
                  building technology based on western construction methods.

                  Ying- Xu, Ge Shang-Xuan, Du Yan-Geng. The missing closer
                  Modern construction projects in China were largely built of
                  western style brickwork. This fact was mentioned in passing by
                  Joseph Needham (1900-95) in his tome devoted to traditional
                  Chinese technology. The Needham work, however, did not pay
                  attention to the potentially different origins of western
                  brickwork. In regards to the brick structures built in ancient
                  China, the possible foreign sources of influence have been
                  skilfully addressed in a few Chinese publications.2 The brick
                  structures built in modern China (1840-1949) display
                  omnipresent western references, but they have not yet been
                  properly studied in either the Chinese or English literature.
                  In Shanghai, western brick masonry became the dominant method
                  to construct western-style buildings in 1843-1910, and it was
                  only from the 1910s onward that reinforced concrete frames
                  gradually replaced brick masonry structures. Recent technical
                  studies, have begun to reveal the epochal revolution of
                  brickmaking in modern China, showing the slow process of
                  establishing a new manufacturing industry to support brick
                  construction methods. In this transitional period of
                  1843-1936, the brick construction methods changed
                  significantly, but these changes have been hitherto
                  undocumented. The author has devoted efforts to the study of
                  the application of western brickwork principally in Shanghai
                  with a comparative view towards other Chinese cities.
                  Approximately 300 brickwork buildings have been identified and
                  examined in particular. Architectural and archaeological
                  methods have been utilised to identify brickworks in situ.
                  Repeated comparisons have been conducted between various
                  Chinese and western resources. The Chinese bonds that Needham
                  noted seem very rare in Shanghai's modern construction
                  projects; and there are no obvious western bonds in
                  traditional buildings built before 1843, the date that the
                  British Settlement was established. Shanghai brickwork appears
                  to be less colourful and to have less diversity than British
                  works in general. Neat English bonds and Flemish bonds have
                  prevailed in both structural masonries and non-structural
                  walls built in Shanghai throughout the period between 1866 and
                  1949. Compared to the English brickwork built in England
                  during the same period, and in spite of the visible
                  similarities between these two worlds of brickwork,
                  surprisingly, the Shanghai brickwork generally appears to be
                  independent of "closer" brick, which were very popular in
                  England. This hitherto unrecognised detail renders the modern
                  brickwork of Shanghai distinct from not only the English
                  examples, but also the western brickwork built in other
                  Chinese cities such as Guangzhou and Wuhan, where "closers"
                  are visible. What were the sources of the western brickwork in
                  Shanghai? Architectural literature seems to support the
                  hypothesised link to British sources, and suffice to say that
                  the design of western buildings was dominated by British
                  architects, engineers and clients in the period of the
                  1840s-1910s. The workmen, however, were almost always Chinese.
                  Remarkably, the architect George Strachan (1821-1899) from
                  Edinburgh opened a construction school to train Chinese
                  workers when he sojourned in Shanghai between 1849 and 1854.5
                  The trainees were mostly from Ningbo and subsequently became a
                  noted group among the several groups of workers building
                  Shanghai. Chinese historians often express the idea that the
                  isolated groups of workers probably helped to maintain
                  different construction skills; this idea, however, does not
                  seem to be embodied in the western brickwork surveyed by the
                  author. How has western (British) technology been circulated,
                  translated and disseminated in brickwork? To answer this
                  question, this paper examines the printed technical materials
                  that have been rather less studied. The aim is not only to
                  explain the phenomena in brickwork but also to draw attention
                  to the potential historical pattern(s) in circulating western
                  construction technology in modern China. English "closer" and
                  the "Chinese bond" The bonding of bricks was considered of
                  great importance for structural strength, stability,
                  homogeneity, and the stylistic appearance of architecture;
                  "closers" were used to ensure the proper interlocking of
                  bricks to avoid continuous vertical joints, which would cause
                  the wall to split from top to bottom. This technology is well
                  represented in the English literature from 1700 to the 1930s,
                  and Joseph Moxon (1703) provided what was likely the earliest
                  pertinent record with the detailed descriptions of "closier/
                  closure" both in words (the citation below) and in
                  illustration. (Fig. 1, top)
