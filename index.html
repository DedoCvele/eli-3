            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
              Bricklaying in China represents one of the most fundamental and
              historically significant construction practices in the world. With
              a history spanning over 5,000 years, Chinese bricklaying
              techniques have evolved from simple clay brick construction to
              sophisticated architectural methodologies that combine traditional
              wisdom with modern innovation.
            </p>
            <p>
              This study examines the current state of bricklaying practices in
              China, focusing on both traditional methods and contemporary
              applications. The research encompasses various aspects including
              material selection, construction techniques, quality control
              measures, and the integration of modern technology in the
              bricklaying process.

                  Changxue Shu舒畅雪 University of Leuven Abstract China's move
                  towards western models of construction is documented by an
                  account of the inconspicuous brickwork of Shanghai-one of the
                  earliest western construction methods introduced into modern
                  China. A series of questions are raised, based on extensive
                  fieldwork. This article records the study of printed resources
                  set within the broader context of circulating western
                  knowledge in China, and summarises types of literature
                  important for construction studies. The paper considers three
                  Chinese books to help explore the sources of western masonry
                  and reveal hitherto un-noted facts. The paper concludes, for
                  the first time, that the simple technology of Victorian brick
                  masonry was a principal source and antecedent of modern
                  Shanghai brickwork. Distinct from the tradition of
                  transmitting construction-related technology by oral
                  instruction, textbooks, handbooks and manuals constituted a
                  new, and powerful means for the dissemination of technical
                  knowledge in modern China. The interpretation of western
                  technology appears to have been selective in Shanghai; a
                  typical example is the brick bonding methods independent of
                  closer bricks compared to English construction. Interestingly,
                  Chinese authors did not fully adopt western construction
                  modes, and old Chinese knowledge was incorporated into new
                  systems of construction, greatly conditioned by material
                  problems, as this study reveals. The spread of construction
                  technology knowledge involved broad cross-field collaboration

                  Modern construction projects in China were largely built of
                  western style brickwork. This fact was mentioned in passing by
                  Joseph Needham (1900-95) in his tome devoted to traditional
                  Chinese technology. The Needham work, however, did not pay
                  attention to the potentially different origins of western
                  brickwork. In regards to the brick structures built in ancient
                  China, the possible foreign sources of influence have been
                  skilfully addressed in a few Chinese publications.2 The brick
                  structures built in modern China (1840-1949) display
                  omnipresent western references, but they have not yet been
                  properly studied in either the Chinese or English literature.
                  In Shanghai, western brick masonry became the dominant method
                  to construct western-style buildings in 1843-1910, and it was
                  only from the 1910s onward that reinforced concrete frames
                  gradually replaced brick masonry structures. Recent technical
                  studies, have begun to reveal the epochal revolution of
                  brickmaking in modern China, showing the slow process of
                  establishing a new manufacturing industry to support brick
                  construction methods. In this transitional period of
                  1843-1936, the brick construction methods changed
                  significantly, but these changes have been hitherto
                  undocumented. The author has devoted efforts to the study of
                  the application of western brickwork principally in Shanghai
                  with a comparative view towards other Chinese cities.
                  Approximately 300 brickwork buildings have been identified and
                  examined in particular. Architectural and archaeological
                  methods have been utilised to identify brickworks in situ.
                  Repeated comparisons have been conducted between various
                  Chinese and western resources. The Chinese bonds that Needham
                  noted seem very rare in Shanghai's modern construction
                  projects; and there are no obvious western bonds in
                  traditional buildings built before 1843, the date that the
                  British Settlement was established. Shanghai brickwork appears
                  to be less colourful and to have less diversity than British
                  works in general. Neat English bonds and Flemish bonds have
                  prevailed in both structural masonries and non-structural
                  walls built in Shanghai throughout the period between 1866 and
                  1949. Compared to the English brickwork built in England
                  during the same period, and in spite of the visible
                  similarities between these two worlds of brickwork,
                  surprisingly, the Shanghai brickwork generally appears to be
                  independent of "closer" brick, which were very popular in
                  England. This hitherto unrecognised detail renders the modern
                  brickwork of Shanghai distinct from not only the English
                  examples, but also the western brickwork built in other
                  Chinese cities such as Guangzhou and Wuhan, where "closers"
                  are visible. What were the sources of the western brickwork in
                  Shanghai? Architectural literature seems to support the
                  hypothesised link to British sources, and suffice to say that
                  the design of western buildings was dominated by British
                  architects, engineers and clients in the period of the
                  1840s-1910s. The workmen, however, were almost always Chinese.
                  Remarkably, the architect George Strachan (1821-1899) from
                  Edinburgh opened a construction school to train Chinese
                  workers when he sojourned in Shanghai between 1849 and 1854.5
                  The trainees were mostly from Ningbo and subsequently became a
                  noted group among the several groups of workers building
                  Shanghai. Chinese historians often express the idea that the
                  isolated groups of workers probably helped to maintain
                  different construction skills; this idea, however, does not
                  seem to be embodied in the western brickwork surveyed by the
                  author. How has western (British) technology been circulated,
                  translated and disseminated in brickwork? To answer this
                  question, this paper examines the printed technical materials
                  that have been rather less studied. The aim is not only to
                  explain the phenomena in brickwork but also to draw attention
                  to the potential historical pattern(s) in circulating western
                  construction technology in modern China. English "closer" and
                  the "Chinese bond" The bonding of bricks was considered of
                  great importance for structural strength, stability,
                  homogeneity, and the stylistic appearance of architecture;
                  "closers" were used to ensure the proper interlocking of
                  bricks to avoid continuous vertical joints, which would cause
                  the wall to split from top to bottom. This technology is well
                  represented in the English literature from 1700 to the 1930s,
                  and Joseph Moxon (1703) provided what was likely the earliest
                  pertinent record with the detailed descriptions of "closier/
                  closure" both in words (the citation below) and in

                  Figure 1. The cohesive continuity from 1700 using closers in
                  English brickworks. In the Victorian period, a "closer" was
                  made the same length and thickness as ordinary bricks and was
                  cut into a shape in which either one or two ends were half the
                  width of the brick, called "King closer" or "Queen closer",
                  respectively. In either the English or Flemish bonding style,
                  a closer brick should be inserted next to the smaller end of
                  the corner brick and laid through the thickness of the wall in
                  every course; it thus appears as half width on the outside
                  surfaces of brick masonries. Consistently, inserting a
                  "closer" became a rule to ensure good English brickwork. This
                  English bonding method was well illustrated in modern Chinese
                  construction books. (Fig. 2) Traditional Chinese brickworks
                  did not use "closers". The ways in which bricks fit together
                  gained little space in the classical Chinese literature on
                  construction, yet they have been well documented by
                  architectural historians since the twentieth century.? In
                  Shanghai, traditional local houses and temples were mostly one
                  or two storeys high, and they depended on timber-framed
                  structures; their brick walls often carried no additional
                  loads or quite low loads. In this system, the Chinese
                  developed a highly- sophisticated craftsmanship culture of
                  brickwork with the effort and skill embedded in the texture,
                  rather than in structural functions. From the mid-nineteenth
                  century, western buildings relying on brick masonry structures
                  were largely realised in all of the Treaty Ports of China; in
                  Shanghai, this trend started with the British Settlement.
                  Chinese bricklaying methods started to be recognised and
                  compared to western methods. At the Austro- Hungarian
                  Universal Exhibition in Vienna in 1873, a Chinese bricklaying
                  method called "hollow wall" was illustrated by a model of a
                  Chinese house in the section of "illustrative of local
                  peculiarities" from the Treaty Port of Kiukiang (present
                  Jiujiang) in Central China. It was superintended by Henry
                  Charles Joseph Kopsch, the then-British commissioner of the
                  Chinese Maritime Customs at Kiukiang. He strongly recommended
                  the "hollow wall principle of the Chinese" for boundary walls
                  or enclosures. 10 It was called the "Chinese box bond" by
                  Rudolf P. Hommel, who lived in China from 1921 to 1926 and
                  from 1928 to 1930; his fieldwork based in Central China has
                  resulted in a good account of the Chinese "brick bonds used in
                  brick walls", Later, Needham associated Chinese bonds with
                  traditional English building technology and provided two
                  illustrations for the "Chinese box bond" in particular.12 In
                  fact, the Chinese "hollow wall" or "box bond" is not an
                  European type of hollow wall (or cavity wall) used for
                  improving the physical conditions of architecture but is only
                  a way to economise brick materials; this method was rarely
                  used by westerners and only applied to non-loadbearing walls
                  in single-storey or two- storey Chinese houses. (Fig. 3) shows
                  this type of bonding method, as applied in a modern laboratory
                  building photographed by Needham but never used in his work13
                  and illustrated in a modern construction book, Jianzhu Tu'an,
                  which is detailed later. This bricklaying method is incapable
                  of carrying powerful loads or ensuring solid stability, as
                  confirmed by recent analyses, 14 There are two more typical
                  models of Chinese bonds widely used in the modern period. One
                  is the "Chinese cross bond", as Needham called it; in every
                  course, the headers and stretchers were arranged alternately,
                  with the latter placed in groups of three in the front
                  elevation. Zhang Ying-Xu-the Tientsinese professor who taught

                  aesthetically, it was as pleasing as English bond but seemed
                  inferior to Flemish bond.15 As far as the author observed, it
                  has an analogous front pattern to the so-called "(Flemish)
                  garden-wall bond", "boundary wall bond", "Sussex bond", or
                  "Scotch bond",16 which in Britain was applied to walls one
                  brick thick that were seen on both sides, such as in dwarf
                  walls, boundary walls, and garden walls, instead of in
                  architecture. English books usually state that this method was
                  created on account of the varied lengths of the bricks, and it
                  was advantageous to adjust the back face by decreasing the
                  number of headers. The third type of Chinese bond, based on
                  the author's fieldwork, consists of one course of headers to
                  two, three, five, or seven courses of stretchers. (Fig. 5) In
                  the front elevation, such bonds might remind one of some of
                  the English bonding methods for one-brick walls, such as
                  so-called "Scottish bond","7 "Facing bond", 1" or "English
                  garden-wall bond",19 yet they are not actually the same. In
                  the modern brick buildings of Shanghai, surprisingly, it is
                  very difficult to find these three types Chinese bonds. Modern
                  Shanghai generally exhibits a westernised form of brickwork
                  using very common building techniques, indicating a systematic
                  change in construction knowledge. of

                  Printed western resources circulated in Shanghai There were a
                  large number of construction-related books circulated in
                  modern China, printed in either western languages or Chinese.
                  The Chinese language books largely relied on western source
                  materials with English, French, and German sources consulted.
                  The links to English sources have been partly demonstrated
                  through case-by-case comparison in recent studies.20 However,
                  very little has been said about the western language books in
                  either the established architectural history or the
                  bibliographical studies of the history of science and
                  technology of modern China. As far as the author can
                  determine, western language books played an important role in
                  circulating new construction technology in China, but the
                  methods of circulating this knowledge were not always the same
                  as the Chinese books. Secondly, the introduction of western
                  construction technology involved not only monographs on
                  building construction but also other technical literature from
                  quite diverse fields, such as the construction of

                <p>
                  After the turn of the twentieth century, Chinese authors
                  started to undertake the mission of re-interpreting western
                  knowledge based on their own experiences gained through past
                  decades of practice. This re- interpretation makes the Chinese
                  books of this period distinct from the earlier materials
                  translated by the Kiangnan Arsenal in Shanghai. Meanwhile,
                  textbooks for civil engineering and architecture were entire
                  reprints of original sources in western languages in
                  Shanghai.25 Printed resources covered textbooks, handbooks,
                  manuals, periodicals, magazines, monographs, unpublished
                  theses, published scientific articles, reports and accounts
                  from scientific institutions, newspaper columns and so on.
                  Advertisements and catalogues showed rich, continually updated
                  information. Among these materials, content about brickwork
                  construction still largely relies on English sources, and it
                  has a very large readership, including technicians, builders,
                  artisans, architects and engineers. There was a notably rising
                  trend in engineering resources. The engineering resources
                  largely came from the United States. This can be partially
                  explained by the United States funding the Boxer Indemnity
                  Scholarship Programme (1909-37) for Chinese students to study
                  in the States, which became the most effective and influential
                  programme for the Chinese. In this period, the whole
                  construction sector was greatly influenced by engineering
                  sciences and technology. In universities, remarkably, the new
                  generation of Chinese engineers started to publish laboratory
                  reports on the physical and structural behaviours of
                  brickwork. In Shanghai, this work was undertaken by the newly
                  established Material Test Committee of the Chinese Engineering
                  Society in 1924-25, based on the laboratory settings in Nan
                  Yang College of Chiao Tung (present Shanghai Jiao Tong
                  University).26 The society's experimental and analytical
                  studies of brickwork showed a new approach to masonry
                  construction in China. The team leader, Ling Hong-Xun
                  (1894-1981), was an important railway engineer of modern China
                  with rich practical experience. Between 1924 and 1936 he
                  published monographs on railroad engineering (1925), municipal
                  engineering (1926), bridges (1929), and the building design of
                  factories (1933) that discussed construction technology at
                  length; they were all used as textbooks and were reprinted
                  several times, followed by more works by Ling.27 Industrial
                  schools constituted another important path for circulating
                  western knowledge. In the Zhengji Construction Industrial
                  SchoolE, established by the Shanghai Builders' Association in
                  the autumn of 1930, the western training mode was applied with
                  technical textbooks all in English; The Builder provided a
                  complete list of the textbooks for the Zhengji school for the
                  year 1936.28 (Table 2) shows the sources of the Zhengji
                  textbooks annotated by the author; most of them were American.
                  British sources included the Building Construction for
                  Beginners authored by J. W. Riley (full name unknown) and the
                  textbook Geometrical Drawing by Alfred Ernest Holbrow. Riley
                  was a lecturer in descriptive geometry, building construction,
                  carpentry and joinery at the municipal technical school,
                  Rochdale, in Britain, and his book discussed brick masonry
                  construction extensively. Holbrow assisted George Arthur
                  Mitchell in another popular English textbook, Building
                  Construction (Fig. 6), and this book became a model for
                  Chinese authors compiling construction books, as elaborated
                  later. Regulations and by-laws formulated and standardised the
                  practice of western brick masonries at the urban level. The
                  1869 by-laws of the third Land Regulation for the Foreign
                  Settlement of Shanghai specified construction issues for the
                  first time. From 1869 until the end of the 1930s, walling
                  technology continued to be a topic of all the different
                  regulations issued by the three independent authorities of
                  Shanghai: The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International
                  Settlement; Conseil d'Administration Municipale de la
                  Concession Française de Changhai; and the Chinese government.
                  Rules were set to secure structural stability, prevention of
                  fires, sanitary, ventilation, and the proper use of space, and
                  they often strictly controlled the building plans, types, and
                  materials and the width, length, and height of walls to be
                  built. A preliminary review showed that the contents and
                  formats of the rules released by the International Settlement
                  were very comparable to the building acts, by-laws, and
                  regulations enforced then in Britain.

                  Three Chinese books of construction Concerning the development
                  of western masonry technology in China, three Chinese books
                  deserve the most attention (Table 3). The Chinese authors, of
                  distinct backgrounds, all devoted themselves to introducing
                  western construction technology. Considerations, meanwhile,
                  were deliberately given to the practical realities in China.
                  The books were well illustrated and in a recently published
                  list of modern Chinese architectural books, all three are
                  considered as sources of modern Chinese architecture,29
                  Jianzhu Xinfa, the English title of which is Building
                  Construction, was published by the Printing Commercial Press,
                  Ltd. in Shanghai and was compiled by Chang Ying Hsu (or Zhang
                  Ying-Xu) (1877-?), with a new edition in 1910. The cover of
                  the book reads, "Building Construction, Mr. Chang Ying Hsu,
                  Prof. Peking Industrial School and Second Assistant Secretary,
                  Board of Agriculture, Work, & Commerce, China". It was used as
                  a textbook of architecture in the Peking Industrial School.
                  Zhang, from Tientsin (Tianjin), received his architectural
                  education at Tokyo Imperial University in Japan. According to
                  him, this work was based on other books on the same subject
                  from both the East and the West; at the same time, he focused
                  on practicability according to his professional experience and
                  years of on-site investigations. The book contains a
                  comprehensive and integrated knowledge of

                  Yinzao Xue (Building Science, trans. the author) is the title
                  of ten serialised articles published from February 1935 to
                  January 1936 in the local Chinese periodical Jianzhu Yuekan
                  (English title The Builder). It was published monthly in
                  Shanghai from November 1932 to April 1937 for a total of 5
                  volumes, 49 issues. Although incorporated into the periodical,
                  it is virtually a single piece resembling a textbook and
                  manual. The author, Du Yan-Geng (1896-1961), was a builder,
                  journal editor and lecturer. He was born into a builder's
                  family in Shanghai,34 and he was then in charge of his family
                  business and worked on establishing the Shanghai Builders'
                  Association (1931), of which he was on the presidential board.
                  He was the chief editor of The Builder and the compiler of the
                  English-Chinese & Chinese-English Dictionary of Architecture,
                  the former issued by the same Shanghai Builders' Association.
                  He taught architecture and English in the Zhengji continuation
                  school erected by the same association. He also translated a
                  series of essays entitled Jianzhu Shi (architectural history)
                  in The Builder from the July 1935 issue onwards. In the text
                  of Yingzao Xue, Du emphasised that his material aimed for
                  applied western building science in Chinese practice, and his
                  main source was on-site experience, which he had undertaken
                  for twenty years. He devoted a lengthy discussion to the
                  brickwork technology used at Shanghai, which was well
                  illustrated. The dates of these publications cover the most
                  prosperous period in construction practices in Shanghai. This
                  fact first made the author speculate on some possible
                  variations between the earlier techniques (as presented in the
                  1910 book) and the later ones (as presented in the 1920 manual
                  or the 1936 periodical). However, it is difficult to find any
                  significant variation in the content related to brick-walling
                  technology. The actual difference between the materials relies
                  on textual style rather than on technology per se. This fact
                  testifies and confirms the outcome of the author's field
                  investigation; that is, no later than the early twentieth
                  century, the local brick walling technology was fixed and
                  shaped. Because The Builder Fildevoted a serialised space to
                  recording and disseminating the existing knowledge of
                  brickwork, it is reasonable to infer that the simple
                  technology of brickwork, as a Victorian legacy, was still a
                  very popular building method in Shanghai in 1936. The contents
                  are all organised in a systematic manner, especially in the
                  textbook of Zhang. Scientific principles, engineering
                  mathematics and science, before the practical details of
                  know-how, are arranged by subject. Walling technology is
                  aligned with other building techniques, such as piling,
                  roofing, plumbing, and water-proofing, in an attempt to
                  achieve an integrated framework. Moreover, Du devoted a large
                  space to the tools, facilities, and machines used in building
                  industry. All of the technical illustrations are drawn in the
                  western, scientific manner and no longer with the type of
                  Chinese graphics to which Needham and other historians often
                  referred.35 How to regulate technical drawings scientifically
                  became an important topic in the works of Zhang (1910) and Du
                  (1935-36). As a whole, these three items represent the level
                  that the Chinese attained in learning and mastering the
                  western technology of construction; a new system developed. In
                  brickwork, the term "bond" was interpreted as "liansuo by
                  Zhang (1910) and as "zuqi" by Du (1935). Du's work provided
                  the most detailed and comprehensive record of the three. In
                  the Preface of Yingzao Xue, Du first stated that he had read
                  Mitchell's "Building Construction and Drawing" twenty years
                  earlier.36 Distance between the Mitchell and the Chinese
                  books: Sources and contents Since the Chinese authors often
                  stated that the books incorporated their own experiences in
                  China, how did the local conditions determine the true
                  practice and knowledge circulating across cultures? To answer
                  this question, the author examined the distance between the
                  Chinese books and their English source

                  constructing brick masonry in all aspects from an architect's
                  point of view. In particular, it discusses the typology of
                  brick masonry, brick arches, and bonds
                  (English/Flemish/Chinese bonds of brickwork). This textbook is
                  considered the earliest Chinese monograph based on the modern
                  science of building construction.30 Jianzhu Tu'an (A Complete
                  Collection of Building Construction Illustrated, trans, the
                  author) was first published in 1920 by Chong Wen Shu Ju in
                  Shanghai and Guangzhou and was reprinted in 1924. The author
                  Ge Shang-Xuan (1896-?) was born in Shanghai and later worked
                  as a cartographer, surveyor and building engineer, in that
                  order. He had worked for the Han-Ye- Ping Iron and Steel
                  Company in Central China for years before returning to
                  Shanghai in 1918. Only two years later, Ge published this
                  book, stating that it was compiled and interpreted according
                  to his own working experience." In Shanghai, Ge worked in the
                  Project Bureau under the Shanghai Municipal Council of the
                  International Settlement. The Han-Ye-Ping Iron and Steel
                  Company hired a large number of foreign engineers and
                  technicians from Britain, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany and the
                  United States in the period between 1890 and 1912, including
                  "Konstrukteur", with recorded names including Franz Hoffmann
                  and Victor Moyen (both from Luxembourg).32 It is interesting
                  to note that Ge obtained his building construction expertise
                  in the iron- making industry. This type of inter-field contact
                  is also highlighted in the construction of the then most
                  marvellous brick structure, Holy Trinity Church in Shanghai,
                  1866-69, which engaged a ship repairing company, Messrs. S. C.
                  Farnham & Co., as the builder.33 In nineteenth-century China,
                  the sources for developing modern construction were quite
                  complex. The contents of Ge's book cover materials,
                  craftsmanship, and the construction of brick masonry; they are
                  largely based on English knowledge, and the illustrations are
                  almost a copy of English illustrations. (Fig. 7) Ge's book is
                  basically a manual compared to Zhang's textbook.

                  a complete list of all the different editions of the books
                  based on the libraries of Cambridge University, Oxford
                  University, and the Getty Research Institute. The books'
                  contents show that Brickwork has been incorporated into
                  Construction I since 1926, 10th ed., after C. F. Mitchell died
                  and G. A. Mitchell took over. Although the Mitchell books
                  could not portray the whole spectrum of construction methods
                  in popular English books on building technology, the
                  continually reprinted contents on the subject of brickwork
                  were largely representative for the time. The Mitchell
                  textbooks present a solid representation of bricklaying
                  methods. Therefore, the three Mitchell books of varied
                  editions are considered an integrated whole in this study.
                  (Fig. 6) Almost every edition of Construction I provides a
                  reference list (except the 5th ed. of 1900 and the 6th ed. of
                  1902, reprinted in 1903), as does Construction 2 from the 1st
                  ed. of 1894 to the 7th ed. of 1912. There are no reference
                  lists in Brickwork. Construction 2 built on bibliographical
                  sources richer than Construction I compiled at the same time
                  (Fig. 7). Prior to 1906, there were few or slight changes
                  between editions, compared to the previous one. In 1906, the
                  reference lists in both books, viz Construction I and
                  Construction 2, were thoroughly revised and greatly enlarged,
                  with approximately half of the previous mentioned works cut
                  and supplemented by new sources "in the science of
                  construction and in the direction of the standardisation of
                  materials" 38 Relatively small changes continued in subsequent
                  editions, updated with the latest, more specialised knowledge
                  covering architecture, civil engineering, building practice,
                  material, sanitation, and by-laws.(Fig. 7) These updates on
                  new developments in the construction field are not reflected
                  at all in the works of Zhang (1910), Ge (1920-24), and Du
                  (1935-36). The Chinese interpretation of English material is
                  based almost entirely on old Victorian technology from the
                  nineteenth century. The most marked resemblance between the
                  Chinese and English material are the illustrations; there are
                  larger gaps in the text. (Fig. 8) demonstrates the similarity
                  between the comparable content from Mitchell (Construction 1,
                  1900, pp. 19-21) and Ge (Jianzhu Tu'an, 1924, pp. 42-4); the
                  bold numbers marked by the author correspond with the caption
                  numbers of Mitchell's figures. Ge's illustrations of western
                  brickwork are completely identical to Mitchell's illustrations
                  of English bond and double Flemish bond in Construction 1-the
                  thoroughly revised and much enlarged 5th edition of 1900 and
                  not the earlier editions. However, Ge's illustration of both
                  English bonds and double Flemish bonds contains serious
                  errors, as marked with bold crosses by the author. The wrong
                  drawing lines indicate that Ge did not truly capture the
                  professional language in drawing a structure.

                  Figure 8. (a, b to continue) The similarity and distance
                  between Mitchell (1900, left) and Ge (1924, right), English
                  bonds and double Flemish bonds. Between Du and Mitchell, it
                  suffices to say that Du's illustrations of brickwork,
                  annotated with Chinese terms, were almost identical to the
                  corresponding ones in Mitchell's books, the contents of which
                  include English bond, single Flemish bond, double Flemish
                  bond, stretching bond, heading bond, herring-bone bond,
                  diagonal bond, raking bond, and facing bond. Du recorded that
                  English bond and Flemish bond were the most popular types used
                  by the Chinese then; this report concurs with results from the
                  author's fieldwork. Du's knowledge about filling up mortar
                  joints is again analogous to British methods, i.e., so-called
                  "by the trowel", "by larrying", and "by grouting" in
                  Mitchell39 or "filling up joints", "bed joints", and
                  "larrying" in Rivington,40 whose work is also in Mitchell's
                  reference list (see also Fig. 7). They seem to correspond to
                  the Chinese methods called "luokehui", "mandaohui", and
                  "woqi", respectively, with slight adjustments by Du.11 Other
                  content, such as wetting and pointing, consists of almost
                  direct translation from Mitchell. Nevertheless, Du's
                  illustrations do not always correspond to the text he wrote.
                  The lacunas and dissimilarities are repeatedly revealed in
                  Du's interpretation of Victorian brickwork.

                  The use of closer brick was detailed in nearly all of the
                  English books elaborating on brickwork, including the Mitchell
                  books in the first edition (Construction 1, 1888); the three
                  Chinese books also discussed "closers" in either words or
                  illustration. In Britain, closer bricks were all neatly
                  arranged in architectural models designed by, for instance,
                  Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin, William Butterfield and George
                  Gilbert Scott,42 (Fig. 9, in hatching), as well as in average
                  English houses. In the brick buildings of Shanghai, however,
                  closers are extensively (if not totally) absent, even in those
                  works designed by British architects such as George Gilbert
                  Scott and William Macdonnell Mitchell Dowdall. (Fig. 10) Since
                  the above study has shown that Shanghai brickwork was largely
                  modelled on English prototypes, then what is the hidden reason
                  for the absence of closers?

                  The brick industry: Economy and standardisation One important
                  yet unstudied cause could be related to the supply of bricks
                  at Shanghai. Throughout the period of 1843-1936, the brick
                  industry underwent a shift from a traditional system to a new
                  mode, and the supply of bricks depended on both the
                  traditional brickyards, which produced Chinese "blue bricks",
                  and the new, not yet developed modern factories which aimed at
                  manufacturing "red bricks" mimicking European types and
                  methods. The latest study revealed that, in the period of
                  1843-1925, the mechanical qualities of industrially processed
                  red bricks did not outperform the bricks made in traditional
                  brickyards in general.43 This transitional period in brick
                  making coincided with the time when Chinese workers adapted to
                  building western brick masonries and developed new skills. In
                  Shanghai, it seems that, using machinery, bricks were produced
                  more expensively than by hand prior to 1933. The local
                  magazine The Builder (November 1932 - April 1937, 5 vols., 49
                  issues) provided the monthly market prices for all types of
                  building materials. Based on these data, (Fig. 11) shows the
                  trends in the prices of the bricks from eight popular
                  producers in Shanghai; modern machine- made bricks are marked
                  with filled shapes, while traditionally made bricks are
                  hollow, and different shapes represent different producers. It
                  is clear that, prior to October 1933, traditionally made
                  bricks were less expensive than the machine-made ones of the
                  same size and from the same company. Between October 1933 and
                  January 1936, the prices of the traditionally made bricks and
                  the machine-made ones were not provided in the magazine,
                  likely indicating that they were the same price; from February
                  1936 on, conversely, machine-made bricks became less expensive
                  than the comparable traditional ones. The consequence of the
                  prices can be very well observed in the built brickwork:
                  different types of bricks were tactfully used in combination,
                  and usually, machine-made red bricks were employed in complex
                  forms and/or in decorative positions of the architecture,
                  while traditionally made blue brick was used in simple forms
                  and/or in hidden positions. The economy of blue bricks
                  favoured their wide application late into 1936.

                  dimensions from one another, and they were not standardised
                  until 1953.44 Bricks of different sizes were usually mixed in
                  bonding for economic or aesthetic, architectural reasons. For
                  instance, often the backing bricks were not the same size as
                  the facing bricks, which would frequently result in bad bonds.
                  Non- standardisation in bricks was an innate weakness of model
                  brickwork based on British archetypes. In Britain, the
                  industrialisation of brick making and the standardisation of
                  bricks greatly favoured the use of bricks to satisfy
                  architectural tastes, so industrially made bricks were in
                  general use by the 1880s.45 In British brickwork, the uniform
                  and proportional dimensions of brick units were considered a
                  condition to ensure good bonds. Mitchell's textbooks devoted
                  notable space to the matter. The standardisation of brick size
                  commenced on May 1, 1904, as agreed upon between Royal
                  Institute of British Architects and the Brick Makers'
                  Association, in consultation with Institution of Civil
                  Engineers; this information was continuously updated in later
                  editions.46 The British Standard Specification No. 657 for
                  Dimensions of Clay Facing and Backing Bricks of 1936 specified
                  the dimensions of closers and suggested the same sizes for the
                  backing bricks and the facing bricks.47 Three measurement
                  systems had been used at Shanghai by the 1930s: the customary
                  Chinese system; the British imperial system; and the
                  international metric system. According to the 1915 law of
                  measurement, article 2, the Chinese system and the
                  international metric system were both legal and official. In
                  1929, the then newly established Chinese government re-defined
                  the metric system as the only standard; the Chinese system was
                  permitted to be used in a subsidiary manner, but in fact,
                  British imperial units prevailed in the brick industry until
                  the 1930s.48 (Table 4) presents some typical data of the brick
                  dimensions (with tolerances) based on the author's survey both
                  in the literature and in fieldwork. It partially demonstrates
                  the diversity of the brick forms late into the 1930s, although
                  it is far from the whole spectrum. In traditional Chinese
                  kilns, the dimensions of bricks could be decided by clients.
                  Remarkably, the bricks used in the 1866 Holy Trinity
                  Church-designed by George Gilbert Scott and William
                  Kidner-exhibit unique dimensions of all of the Shanghai bricks
                  but identical to those used in A. W. Pugin's Saint Chad's
                  Cathedral, Birmingham (Table 4, Fig. 12), which is a British
                  size. The red bricks were especially made for this Holy
                  Trinity Church architecture in Shanghai in 1866-67.49 The
                  thickness (75 mm) was exceptional and was never exceeded by
                  any other plain brick produced in Shanghai afterwards, with
                  thickness dimensions varying from 25 to 70 millimetres
                  according to the author's survey.

                  With such diverse bricks in Shanghai, the Chinese artisans
                  developed another way to obtain the proper overlaps for
                  western brick masonries. They simply cut the first brick of
                  every course into the qualified lengths - usually 34 bats - to
                  ensure correct overlaps; that is, they used three-quarter bats
                  at the ends of the stretcher courses to omit the closers next
                  to the end headers. The 1866 Scott church was built in this
                  manner-the quoins were cut into % brick bats to achieve the
                  style of English bond (Fig. 12, right). The drawings in (Fig.
                  13) represent Shanghai's "English bond" of a one-brick thick
                  wall in the case of stopped ends and in the case of an
                  external right-angle junction of two walls; the appearance is
                  the same with plain or rebated jambs for openings.

                    Conclusions
                    Western brick masonry-a traditional construction method in Europe-became a modern method for the Chinese and constituted one of the earliest paths to a western construction system at Shanghai. The evolution of brickwork in modern China experienced the overlapping of two approaches: from Chinese technology to western technology, and from traditional technology to modern engineering technology. This study places brickwork in the broader context of technical knowledge circulation.
                    The traditional "Chinese bonds" (including variants) were not used at all in building modern Shanghai. This study concludes that the British Victorian technology of ordinary brick masonry was a principal source that Shanghai brickwork inherited throughout the period of 1843-1936. However, the basic British bonding method of using closer bricks (either queen closers or king closer) was rarely (if ever) adopted in the practice of Shanghai, and Chinese workers employed Victorian technology in a reduced and adaptive manner. Building practice and printed materials were both involved in circulating the technology.
                    The study showed that, from the twentieth century onwards, textbooks and manuals, in either Chinese or
                </p>

                <p>
                    foreign languages, became a new popular approach of knowledge transfer; the technology of brickwork was also widely disseminated in this manner, distinct from the traditional method of oral instruction. This path is crucial to western models of construction in modern China, and it features the modernisation of the construction industry. On the one hand, the Chinese authors-from professors to builders-took up the mission of introducing and disseminating western science and technology, and largely and directly drawing content from western sources, they actively followed a learned western mode in disciplinary language and considered their works "science books450 On the other hand, the secondary Chinese authors of construction books still had difficulties and made mistakes in translating British brickwork across cultures; by 1936, the brickwork that the Chinese authors devoted much space to was still a matter of craft rather than the type of "science of construction" that the Mitchell books evidently displayed after 1906, while the Chinese authors intentionally considered the local reality in their books, which thus honestly reflected how the Chinese reconstructed their knowledge system and mastered their practical skills when confronted with western cultures. In China, modern engineering sciences have influenced brick masonry construction by the introduction of new brick making methods and new laboratory research methods, for instance; however, it is an overstatement to consider the three Chinese construction books as examples of modern construction engineering.
Thirdly, compared with constructed brick buildings, there are both similarities and differences between Victorian brickwork and Shanghai brickwork, indicating the development of local craftsmanship in modern Shanghai. Chinese workers' new skills had been formulated by the end of the nineteenth century at the latest, which can be also confirmed in the built typology of structures. Nevertheless, there are observable gaps and lacunas between the Chinese construction books and the built brickwork, such as the missing "closer", which has been featured in the modern buildings of Shanghai in a very subtle yet omnipresent fashion. An important reason is hidden in the supply of brick materials, as revealed in the paper.
Finally, the study discovered broad connections across different areas of activities in circulating western construction methods and technology. The development of the western construction system, at least in terms of brickwork, involved sources and resources from very diverse fields, such as steel making, ship repairing, and railway, bridge, and canal building. Shanghai was also embedded in a network together with other Treaty Ports, such as Hankou (now part of Wuhan). In addition to Shanghai's internationality, which has been well recognised, this inter-field and inter-space network has been under-studied, and it actually characterises an early phase of establishing a western construction system in China (c. 1843- 1910).
